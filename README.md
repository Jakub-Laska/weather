Weather App

Overview
This project is a simple weather app that allows users to select a weather type from a dropdown menu, enter a temperature in degrees, and receive a description of the weather based on the selected type and temperature. The app also includes a dark mode feature.

What I Learned
- DOM Manipulation: I learned how to use JavaScript to interact with HTML elements. This includes changing element styles, adding and removing event listeners, and updating the content dynamically based on user input.
- Event Handling: I implemented event listeners to handle user interactions such as clicking on dropdown options and submitting temperature values.
- Conditional Logic: I used conditional statements to provide different responses based on the selected weather type and the input temperature.
- Theme Switching: I explored how to create different visual themes for the app and switch between them, including implementing a dark mode.
- Error Handling: I added basic validation to ensure that the user inputs a temperature value before proceeding.

Features
- Dropdown Menu: Users can select a weather type from a dropdown menu.
- Temperature Input: Users can input a temperature value in degrees.
- Weather Descriptions: The app provides a descriptive message based on the selected weather type and temperature.
- Dark Mode: Users can switch between light and dark mode for better visual comfort.
- Error Handling: The app prompts the user to enter a temperature value if none is provided.

Room for Improvement
- Code Refactoring: The code can be improved by refactoring repetitive sections, especially in the theme functions and weather descriptions.
- Accessibility Enhancements: Adding more accessibility features such as ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support could make the app more user-friendly.
- Optimization: Optimize JavaScript and CSS for better performance, especially when dealing with multiple DOM manipulations.
